## Welcome to my website? At least this way I no longer need to squat a domain.

### Markdown
#### Will I no longer write documents in word?

Below is a code block that I wish to keep as an example while I continue learning
```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2 rmbme
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
### I don't really understand all of this just yet
- [x] Make a website*
- [ ] Put "A study guide to an..." on website/github
